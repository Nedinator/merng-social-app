# merng-social-app

> A social media application created to further skills in React, GraphQL, MongoDB, and Node.js. As well as Semantic UI/CSS. This is a bit of a dev 'blog' I guess...

### Progress

> Finished tutorial video, nailing down goals, working on backend for user page/edit profile resolvers/typeDefs. Also, going to set up git repo first then start working on all of this.

### Goals

> These are like notes for me pretty much -

- [ ] User Page
  - [ ] Add mutations for GraphQL - getUsers; getUser
  - [ ] Create routes/pages on React frontend - '/users'
  - [ ] Map each user to a Card with Semantic
- [ ] DARK MODE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - [ ] Needs done asap as I hate working on this at night atm
    - [ ] May add this to mongo schema even to save preferences over devices, for now local storage lol
    - [ ] Research different ways to implement this. Different .css files, classes, applied at App level or spread across all pages/components?
- [ ] Profile Update Page
  - [ ] GraphQL mutations - steams off getUser; editUser
  - [ ] Create semantic forms to display current info.
    - [ ] Password is going to be extra hard
    - [ ] As well as uploading profile pictures and storing them... somewhere?
- [ ] Add likes (maybe replies?) to comments
  - [ ] Update mongo schema
  - [ ] Update all mutations that'll require this info
    - [ ] I'll add these once I get closer.
- [ ] May make CommentSection its own component.
